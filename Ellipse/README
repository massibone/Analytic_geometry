Ellipse is the locus of point that moves such that the sum of its distances from two fixed points called the foci is constant. 
The constant sum is the length of the major axis, 2a.
 
General Equation of the Ellipse
From the general equation of all conic sections, A and C are not equal but of the same sign. 
The general equation of the ellipse is Ax2 + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 or
 

x2+Cy2+Dx+Ey+F=0
