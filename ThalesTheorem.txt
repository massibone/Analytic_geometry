Thale's theorem states that if a triangle is inscribed in a circle 
where one side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, 
then the angle opposite to that side is a right angle.

we first define the coordinates of the triangle vertices, 
and then calculate the distances between them using the Pythagorean theorem. 
We then check if the distance AB is equal to twice the distance BC and AC, 
which would indicate that AB is a diameter of the circle passing through 
A, B, and C. If this condition is true, we print that Thale's theorem is true,
otherwise we print that it is false.
