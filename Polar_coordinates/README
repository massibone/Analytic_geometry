Polar coordinate system
Is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.
The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole,
and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate, 
radial distance or simply radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth. 
The radial coordinate is often denoted by r or ρ, and the angular coordinate by φ, θ, or t.

Angles in polar notation are generally expressed in either degrees or radians (2π rad being equal to 360°).
