“Homographic Relation” or “homography” between two real variables {x, y} is a one-to-one
(invertible) function y = f (x) involving algebraic operations only between the variables.


1 Homographic Relation 2
{x, y}. The one-to-one and the algebraic requirements imply that the relation has the form.
y =
ax + b
cx + d
, with ad − bc , 0 ⇔ cxy − ax + dy − b = 0 , (1)
with an inverse function of the same kind
x =
dy − b
−cy + a
. (2)
The graph of the function is a rectangular hyperbola. This is the only kind
of quadratic curve that represents an invertible real function of the “extended real line”
to itself
